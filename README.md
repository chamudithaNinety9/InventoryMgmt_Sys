Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a full-stack application used by automotive parts stores to manage inventory, customers, suppliers, sellers, and product categories efficiently. Built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, the system provides real-time inventory updates, automated stock control, and a seamless management experience for store operations.

Project Description

This Inventory Management System allows automotive parts stores to keep track of their inventory, manage customer and supplier relationships, and efficiently organize product categories. The application automates stock updates during sales and returns, ensuring accurate inventory levels at all times. It also provides essential features for managing returns, damaged items, and generating detailed reports on inventory performance.

Key Features

* Supplier Management: Enables the store to add, edit, or remove sellers, ensuring the accurate tracking of suppliers and optimizing communication for reordering stock or negotiating prices.
* Product Category Management: Provides functionality to create and organize product categories, making it easy to classify and filter parts based on type, brand, or other relevant criteria.
* Product Management: Facilitates adding, editing, and deleting products in the inventory. This includes specifying details such as product names, descriptions, prices, and stock levels.
* Auto-Update Inventory: Automatically adjusts stock levels when products are purchased or returned, ensuring real-time accuracy in inventory counts and reducing the risk of overstocking or       running out of critical parts.
