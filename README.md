This Inventory Management System is currently in use at an automotive parts store to manage inventory, customers, suppliers, sellers, and product categories efficiently. The systemâ€™s frontend, developed with React, provides a smooth, user-friendly interface, while the backend, built with Spring Boot and MySQL, ensures secure data processing and reliable performance. The system automates inventory updates and provides comprehensive control over stock, pricing, returns, and damaged items, offering a scalable solution for managing store operations.
